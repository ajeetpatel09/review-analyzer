I just used to forget all the time, finally I have it now.Well from the last 2 months of use, here's my experience with the product:I use it every night and get a shower in the morning.Pros:1. The oil is non greasy, and pretty light.2. Has very good smell.no pungent or awkward fragrance3. My hair doesn't lump in together as with other hair oil products.4.Gives a pretty good shine and dark color5. It's very helpful for dandruff, hairfall/ hairloss. I don't have a very dense hair presence so my scalp was visible all the time, Now it looks pretty dense.Cons.1 .can't find anything at allI do recommend it for people having hairfall issues.",

          "My 2 year old child doesn't have cavity but started developing bad breaths the morning after, while using this toothpaste for a couple of weeks during day and night brushing sessions. I feel this toothpaste might actually cause cavity rather than keep it away, from my experience. I immediately shifted back to Pigeon toothpaste for night brushing and the bad breath stopped from the next day onward.  I had purchased it for its all natural properties. Mama Earth team needs to research more on the ingredients on this product. I use other Mama Earth products and they are decent. Not this toothpaste though.",

Made with 100% safe ingredients, this should be the toothpaste you should introduce your kids to! Mamaearth Berry Blast toothpaste is 100% safe and toxin free. My kids love the Berry taste while brushing. This is one of the best flouride free tooth pastes available for kids that you should be buying right away!",

But this product is good to start eating or tasting rather by baby. that way it is natural and taste good. i applied bit on her teeth thn forgot where i kept it.Buy for your own satisfaction if baby is really small and if understands how to brush and spit or eat than go for it.",

          "Pros:1. Natural strawberry flavour.2. SLS & Fluoride free toothpaste.3. 100% vegan.4. Claims to be plastic responsible.Cons:None that I found in the last few months.Verdict:Recommended toothpaste for kids above 1 year. My son likes it. The strawberry flavour is quite noticeable when you're brushing your kid. Wish if this was available as single pack instead of minimum qty as 2 since it takes quite a lot of time to finish the tube when you are taking only a peanut size or less portion for brushingIf you think my review was helpful, don't forget to click the helpful link below the review.",

          "I bought this because I was super impressed with the ingredients list. This one says it's a skin-lighting face wash which I felt so disappointed about at first but then I realised it makes your skin lighter by removing tan from your face. I am really very impressed with the effects. It leaves my skin squeaky clean and makes it brighter. I really love the fragrance of this face wash.",

          "It's thick.It has beads and I don't know why they want me to scrub my face off everyday !!!It doesn't foam like a facewash.It smells like pulpy orange while applying and then smells a bit like turmeric after washing off.My face looked bright after using it but not as bright as my previous facewashes.Made my skin dry. It was annoying since my skin was already dry without it and it made it worse !It is definitely not worth the money ( I got it for 175rs in a sale.  Still isn't worth it )I don't think it worked on my tan. I still dont see any changes in skin.It's disappointing !!!!",

          "So this is one such facewash free from parabens and sulfate, hence made me order it. Talking about the natural ingredients like turmeric and liquorice extract attracted it more. The consistency of this facewash is bit thick like a scrub making it unusual for others but I loved it as it makes your skin clean and radiant. Best for people who wants to get rid of tanning, discoloration and pigmentation.",

          "Had tried this product majorly because of the name and ingredients that it has. For the first time a company is able to get the product that is based on our ancient secret recipes of our Dadi Nani... a person like me who has super dry skin, this is the perfect product for me as it hydrates my skin thoroughly and gives an instant freshness like the way ubtan gives. Very good for my super dry & super sensitive skin. Loved this product. Kudos mamaearth for this amazing thought behind this product .",
