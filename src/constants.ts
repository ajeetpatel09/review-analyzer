I just used to forget all the time, finally I have it now.Well from the last 2 months of use, here's my experience with the product:I use it every night and get a shower in the morning.Pros:1. The oil is non greasy, and pretty light.2. Has very good smell.no pungent or awkward fragrance3. My hair doesn't lump in together as with other hair oil products.4.Gives a pretty good shine and dark color5. It's very helpful for dandruff, hairfall/ hairloss. I don't have a very dense hair presence so my scalp was visible all the time, Now it looks pretty dense.Cons.1 .can't find anything at allI do recommend it for people having hairfall issues.",

          "My 2 year old child doesn't have cavity but started developing bad breaths the morning after, while using this toothpaste for a couple of weeks during day and night brushing sessions. I feel this toothpaste might actually cause cavity rather than keep it away, from my experience. I immediately shifted back to Pigeon toothpaste for night brushing and the bad breath stopped from the next day onward.  I had purchased it for its all natural properties. Mama Earth team needs to research more on the ingredients on this product. I use other Mama Earth products and they are decent. Not this toothpaste though.",

Made with 100% safe ingredients, this should be the toothpaste you should introduce your kids to! Mamaearth Berry Blast toothpaste is 100% safe and toxin free. My kids love the Berry taste while brushing. This is one of the best flouride free tooth pastes available for kids that you should be buying right away!",

But this product is good to start eating or tasting rather by baby. that way it is natural and taste good. i applied bit on her teeth thn forgot where i kept it.Buy for your own satisfaction if baby is really small and if understands how to brush and spit or eat than go for it.",

          "Pros:1. Natural strawberry flavour.2. SLS & Fluoride free toothpaste.3. 100% vegan.4. Claims to be plastic responsible.Cons:None that I found in the last few months.Verdict:Recommended toothpaste for kids above 1 year. My son likes it. The strawberry flavour is quite noticeable when you're brushing your kid. Wish if this was available as single pack instead of minimum qty as 2 since it takes quite a lot of time to finish the tube when you are taking only a peanut size or less portion for brushingIf you think my review was helpful, don't forget to click the helpful link below the review.",

          "I bought this because I was super impressed with the ingredients list. This one says it's a skin-lighting face wash which I felt so disappointed about at first but then I realised it makes your skin lighter by removing tan from your face. I am really very impressed with the effects. It leaves my skin squeaky clean and makes it brighter. I really love the fragrance of this face wash.",

          "It's thick.It has beads and I don't know why they want me to scrub my face off everyday !!!It doesn't foam like a facewash.It smells like pulpy orange while applying and then smells a bit like turmeric after washing off.My face looked bright after using it but not as bright as my previous facewashes.Made my skin dry. It was annoying since my skin was already dry without it and it made it worse !It is definitely not worth the money ( I got it for 175rs in a sale.  Still isn't worth it )I don't think it worked on my tan. I still dont see any changes in skin.It's disappointing !!!!",

          "So this is one such facewash free from parabens and sulfate, hence made me order it. Talking about the natural ingredients like turmeric and liquorice extract attracted it more. The consistency of this facewash is bit thick like a scrub making it unusual for others but I loved it as it makes your skin clean and radiant. Best for people who wants to get rid of tanning, discoloration and pigmentation.",

For the first time a company is able to get the product that is based on our ancient secret recipes of our Dadi Nani... a person like me who has super dry skin, this is the perfect product for me as it hydrates my skin thoroughly and gives an instant freshness like the way ubtan gives. Very good for my super dry & super sensitive skin. Loved this product. Kudos mamaearth for this amazing thought behind this product .",

          'Hello everyone, Please buy this product only if you are looking for "Moisturizer" .This works as a great moisturizer and it does the job what it claims for but not 100%.Iam writing this review after 1 month of usage and realised that this is a product where 30ml  isn\'t available in original website of "Mamaearth , I  figured out only after purchasing 50 ml from original website of Mamaearth.Ingredients: If you compare the ingredients of 30ml and 50ml : 30ml contains all the chemicals and 50ml consists of all the essential oils which is great.Scent: 30ml bottle has great smell coz all the chemicals are added.50ml bottle has the smell of essential oils which most of them might not like it( Hardly any chemical is added)This I figured out after using the 30ml which I purchased from Amazon and I used it exactly for 1 month and bottle got over, then I was looking to buy another one and I went to Mamaearth original site and figured out this .I would recommend you to compare the ingredients before you buy this from Amazon',

In 50ml cream u ll find essential oils in the ingredients list but in 30ml you will find chemicals list.. totally it's waste of money.",

          "So I am a big fan of MAMA EARTH products and I generally places order from Nykaa. This time thought of giving a try to Amazon. But I am highly disappointed by the product. It seems like a copied product of the original mama earth. The scent is bad and this cream broke me out badly. It is not like the original product. You don't expect this from a product which is on a pricier side.",

I wasn't having any pimple or acne issues but only for concern i switched to herbal facewash and first i picked aroma magic tea tree oil face which was good i applied it on my face for several months but suddenly some acne and pimple attack on my face i didn't know the cause and then i switched to mamaearth face wash but it did nothing on my face used it for 15 days no result i got. Both the product were fail to cure my pimple or acneI don't know what kind of pimple attack it was. only two or three pimple used to occur after healing that again two or three. OMG finally i consulted to doctor.Both the product i purchased with recommandation of fit tuber on YouTube.If your face is free of pimples or acne then you can use these products by replacing chemical products. But if you're suffering from pimples or acne i dont know both the facewashes will work or not. Because everybody has their own skin and their own causes of occuring pimples or acnes.You can buy and try.",

          "I really love services of amazon their delivery their return policy their  packing.Their service towards their customers its applicable.Now product- 3.5 star  Average plus product. odour of the material i didn't like. It smells like medicated facewash. I dont know whether it fights with acne or pimple. I wasn't having any pimple or acne issues but only for concern i switched to herbal facewash and first i picked aroma magic tea tree oil face which was good i applied it on my face for several months but suddenly some acne and pimple attack on my face i didn't know the cause and then i switched to mamaearth face wash but it did nothing on my face used it for 15 days no result i got. Both the product were fail to cure my pimple or acneI don't know what kind of pimple attack it was. only two or three pimple used to occur after healing that again two or three. OMG finally i consulted to doctor.Both the product i purchased with recommandation of fit tuber on YouTube.If your face is free of pimples or acne then you can use these products by replacing chemical products. But if you're suffering from pimples or acne i dont know both the facewashes will work or not. Because everybody has their own skin and their own causes of occuring pimples or acnes.You can buy and try.",

          "I love Mamaearth products and have been using them since six months now. Was looking for a facewash for acne for my mom when I stumbled across Mamaearth's new range of face washes. All the products are chemical free and this one is really gentle on the skin. This comes in an easy squeezy tube. The facewash is clear like a gel and have tea tree fragrance. it really helps fighting acne and in almost two uses, my mother was really impressed. A must buy for anyone fighting acne.",

          "I m editing this review on 11/5/2020, my experience with this product is so disappointing.its quality is lower than regular soap , for any skin type I don't recommend to buy this, not worth for money, it just clean your face with water that's all it do, it's a scam, I bought this product after watching fit YouTubber channel, and I wasted my money; I say don't go after product that says it's natural it's a big scam , not only they don't work on you but they come very very expensive , I use home remedies and some regular Market product.",

          "I have sensitive and acne prone skin. More than active acne i have scars on my face. This face wash shows visible results after 1 usage only. It is very gentle on skin, has a pleasant and mild fragrance. Does not rip off the natural oil from your face, leaves your face deeply cleansed and smooth after wash. It is complete value for money",

It literally hits you.. Will never buy again...The bar is ok ok... Not so good as it claims.... I used on my kid and feel it doesn't cleanse well.  I have a dry skin... I used for myself on face and found that my skin is still dry after washing... So nothing great about the moisturising part and more over I don't feel fresh after washing my face with this bar...

          "Although, it makes a very rich and creamy lather, it starts melting quickly if kept wet. I need to take it out of the bathroom and dry it for the next use as I want to save as much of it as possible because it's costlier than other brands. But, it does a far better job than other brands and it's organic. I'm happy to have this soap in my skincare regimen as an adult who has a very sensitive skin prone to irritation. The best thing about this soap is it doesn't leave any residue, which I'm surprised to see. Other brands leave a thin film which makes skin feel very slippery and smooth and I don't like that. I want my skin to feel naked, fresh and not stripped with moisture. Mamaearth soap as well as the mamaearth baby wash did an excellent job. :)",

Better they market it in the form of liquid body wash. Moreover, the soapy feel doesn't go from the body on few rinse. Worst than Teddy bar which has similar outcome, but better than this.

          'Godrej No. 1 is one of those soaps that has been able to balance all the essential tick points in a common bath soap viz pleasant fragrance, good lather, soft on the skin (I use this during Delhi winters and while some soaps leads to skin drying, Godrej No. 1 leaves the skin soft and moisturized) and economical.I personally love the Lime fragrance but all the other ones are good too and it boils down to an individual preference. Irrespective of the fragrance it will not disappoint. Highly recommend.If you find this review useful then please press the "Helpful" button. Thanks.',

And the fragrance lasts for a little while afterwards. No drying, sticky residue. Does the job well done â. And the amount of bars for the price is an added bonus. I have tried the other well known brand and I like this better.",
